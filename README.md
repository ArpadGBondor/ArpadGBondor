### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gabriel, and I am a Hungarian software developer. I live in a small town in Scotland, and I'm refreshing my web-development skills now.

- ðŸ’‚ I'm currently working as a night porter to support myself while I'm growing my skill set, and building my portfolio.
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently learning HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, NodeJS, Expres, EJS, SQL, MongoDB, ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on something later, but I'd like to finish my current courses first.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I have an approximate knowledge of many things. ðŸ˜Ž
- ðŸ’– Special thanks to everyone who starred my inventory management project! Seeing how many people appreciates my work, really helps me keep going.
